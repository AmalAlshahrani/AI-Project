# Houses prices in the U.S.A

# Backstory: 

Residential real estate market In the regions of the United States of America, real estate prices may change dynamically as it is difficult for property owners to measure pricing standards well. In order to facilitate the pricing process for landlords, we decided to develop a solution that aims to predict real estate prices based on a machine learning algorithm. Specifically, we will use a linear regression model. To do this, we will use the century21global website using comprehensive analysis tools. century21global is a website aimed at people who want to sell their homes and people who are looking for real estate.

# The dataset: 

We compiled the dataset from their website "Century21global.com/ar/for-sale-residential/USA", which targets people wanting to sell their homes and another source (Structured Dataset) containing 7 columns and 1001 rows with extension csv. The data contains the following columns:


-   Avg. Area Income:             Avg. The income of the householder of the city house is located.
-   Avg. Area House Age:          Avg. Age of Houses in the same city.
-   Avg. Area Number of Rooms:    Avg. Number of Rooms for Houses in the same city.
-   Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Avg. Number of Bedrooms for Houses in the same city.
-   Area Population:              Population of the city.
-   Price:                       Price that the house sold at.
-   Address:                     Address of the houses.


# Tools:

- To explore and analyze the data we well use Jupiter Notebook, Python language. 
- Python Libraries: Numpy, matplotlib,seaborn,correlation,pandas and BeautifulSoup.
- In addition, creating and evaluating Linear Regression Model.
