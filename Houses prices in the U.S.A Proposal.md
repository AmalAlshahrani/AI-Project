# Backstory: 

In saudi Arabia Residential real estate  has witnessed influctuation particularly , In Ryiadh .In order to facilitate the pricing process for landlords, we decided to develop a solution that aims to predict real estate prices based on a machine learning algorithm. Specifically, we will use a linear regression model. To do this, we will use the Aqar website using comprehensive analysis tools. Aqar is a website aimed at people who want to sell their homes and people who are looking for real estate.

# The dataset: 

We compiled the dataset from their website "Century21global.com/ar/for-sale-residential/USA", which targets people wanting to sell their homes and another source (Structured Dataset) containing 7 columns and 1001 rows with extension csv. The data contains the following columns:
